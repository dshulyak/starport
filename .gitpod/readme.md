# Welcome to Starport ✨

Starport is an easy to use CLI tool for creating sovereign blockchains. Blockchains created with Starport use Cosmos SDK, the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework.

In front of you is a browser-based development environment. At the bottom of the screen you can see a terminal window, it has `starport` binary pre-installed.

## Quick start

Create a new blockchain and start a node in development:

```
